# TestingCodes4ReorganizedSMILES
The repository contain testing code including recursive validation, ML models and DFT functionalities.
All the codes are in Ipython notebook.
Intial codes were obtained form LLMs of Facebook or OpenAI.
The codes are then modified as per requirement of the study on reorganized SMILES notation.
